## Architecture

The Task-Tracker app follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern, which separates the user interface (View) from the business logic and data (Model and ViewModel). The View is responsible for displaying the data to the user and receiving user input, while the ViewModel interacts with the Model to retrieve and modify the data. The Model is responsible for managing the data and communicating with the Room database for efficient data storage and retrieval.
